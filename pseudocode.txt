Option 1

#array_1 = create total array of bikes 

#add bikes to array

#iterate through array of bikes

#array_2 = if bike.working? ==> array of working bikes

#array_3 = if bike.broken? ==> array of broken bikes


Option 2: capacity = issue

#if bike.working? ==> array_1 of working bikes

#if not ==> array_2  of broken bikes
